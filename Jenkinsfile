/*
    This is an sample Jenkins file for the Weather App, which is a node.js application that has unit test, code coverage
    and functional verification tests, deploy to staging and production environment and use IBM Cloud DevOps gate.
    We use this as an example to use our plugin in the Jenkinsfile
    Basically, you need to specify required 4 environment variables and then you will be able to use the 4 different methods
    for the build/test/deploy stage and the gate
